 Discord-Timestamp-Website

## I have used:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling 
+ Bit of **JavaScript** 



You can add more things to make it even cooler! The comments in the code will help you navigate through it. Have a nice day! :D 


this is a simple site but works for the app called discord how time stamps is set via <t:1670387160:t> its like when a giveaway bot sets it the date changed everyday for x time till it ends this made for people to test and make there bots server better and have a great .
